# The Serene Holds of Urzoa

## The dream:

_An unfamiliar smoke-choked sky is lit ablaze with cinder, every breath burns at your lungs and sears your throat. You are unable to stand just like every time before, blood fills your vision and you can feel your strength and life leaving your body. The roar of battle and blood-curdling screams fill the air, and the usual drumming of heavy footsteps moves closer to you. Above you like every night before you see a massive beast of muscle, fangs, claws, and steel stand over you preparing to deal the finishing blow. As it moves to do so you prepare yourself but something is different._

_The sky splits open, a ray of light splitting the darkness, vaporizing the beast that has tormented your dreams for the last two months. The silhouette of a person can be seen between the rays of light so bright that you can not make out much more than that. "You must find me before this becomes a reality." The man says in a voice so strained that they are barely recognizable as words at all. "The Serene turns to Smolder and the World to ruin. I am trapped, Halaea.." The man's voice falters and a long pause is followed by the ash clouds beginning to overtake the man and his light._

_From where the man floated he is replaced with a blazing yellow eye whose mere gaze seems to sear your skin. The next words are what shock you back to the conscious world, sending a shiver up your spine and a cold sweat across your body._

_"You shall be the final one to die." The voice this time is warped, sounding like two voices overlapping one another._

# Chapter 1 Unrest in Baromenes  

## Baromenes
* city-state (Admiral Jash Vahmez - triton)
* sprawling metropolis of art, music, politics, and military might
* major naval power with most of its budget going towards the upkeep of its ports and navy
* controls many of the trade routes off the coast of the Serene Sea and into the Gilded Sea
* patrol guards wear blue tunics accented with white strips of cloth and full sets of bronze armor, often depicting giant tentacles across the breastplate

### Met at fountain:
* Mags & Clair
* Billie & Valyv
* Lulani
* Damaia of Red Banners

### Death comes.. (herald of Siarus, king of the underworld, harbinger of souls)
* knows Mags/Billie's names and says "Billie" is fated to be the last to die
* three black rectangles are tattooed into her skin just below her bottom lip
* _"There are those who seek you harm, to break the chains of Fate"_
* _"When the time comes, you will need this, do not lose it"_
    * small box (a small vacant red plush on which something could be placed)

**THEORY: Death/Siarus don't like being cheated of the souls being kept from the underworld. They are the ones who sent the nightmares, they gave us the box for the shards of The Corruptor's heart, the king of the underworld want us to "win"?**

### The Chained Ones (battle)
* wear a mismatch of silver and black armor, each adorned with Chains in various manors as if cobbled together themselves, using spears
* bodies have chains, binding the souls to the bodies, break the chains and souls will pass to underworld
* appeared recently, have been attacking villages and when they appeared the painting changed
  * Why did they appear when they did? And, what is the purpose of their attacking villages? 
* 
* when Andropeclis killed, everyone bursted in blue-black flame
* leaders
  * Krykon - Orc (scar, clouded eye), had signet ring, given to Deypho for investigation
    * "Thiovanya was right, the box and the pawns all in one area." => longest reigning Oracle of Thespoe (a 7 day walk from Baromenes), he's dead and is "buried" in the Xorinófot Mountains in between here and Thespoe
  * Andropeclis - Human (sickly pale), had sliver of The Corruptor's heart and signet ring (with Lulani?)

### Deypho
* triton, a golden breastplate with the depictions of crossed tridents, lavender-colored strips of leather with gold trim, trident
* sent to deliver a parchment
    * "The Serene turns to Smolder and the World to ruin. It starts at the Akropoli when the moons overtake the sun."
      * both moons eclipse the sun only once about every 18 months, not sure exactly when, but this month

* Deypho guided them past Akrópoli (where orators and the admiral decide on political matters) to a temple dedicated to a saint of Xoros
  * Xoros is the god of magic, the moon's creator, and many believe magic is at its strongest during an eclipse. He is the father of the magical leylines that snake around Olara and is the only reason magic is present in the mortal realm.
  * TBD: is it odd that she didn't know when the eclipse is, given the god Xoros?
  
* Gives them a scroll/painting depicting a great battle between a shadowy figure wrapped in onyx chains that move from and about his body versus six heroes. Their battle dances across the parchment as if animated. The scroll shows the entire events of a war waged between the two groups until finally, the heroes manage to slay the shadowy figure and bring light to the realm. Under each hero, a name in gold glittered and shined, waving like banners in the wind. From left to right the names read as such: Dae, Mags, Damaia, Wilhelmina, Lulani...
  * scroll wrote itself 5 years ago(?), Deypho brought it to the Oracle of Thespoe... then they tracked us down... to make sure this prophecy comes true.
  * Serysh from Erenae, was a sixth name, he died "scrubbed his name from the strings of Fate"
  * painting also changed when: the Shadowy One's army appeared... it changes whenever either side gets closer to reaching their goal

* Tells us that the Chained Ones will be looking for us...
* we are marked with bright yellow sigils (Mags: cat, Deypho: bird)
* presents us with a splinter of wrought metal, about an inch long, jagged and shattered on either... deep black, begging to be picked up
  * It is a piece of an artifact **known to be able to control the will of others**
  * The Spear of Varaxis shattered a black wrought artifact in the Battle of Eternal Fires... which was the climactic conflict of the Corrupter versus Archon Thalysios. At the end of the battle, spears of light descended from Siopos and destroyed much of the enemy armour and its foul creatures. 

**THEORY: The shards are pieces of The Corruptor's heart and they seek completion**

  ### The Corruptor
  *  We can for more information in the great libraries in Anthropoi and the Oria in the Storm Quarter.
